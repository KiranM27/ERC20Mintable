## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the NodeERC20 token and a Python FastAPI backend that interacts with it. The NodeERC20 token is an ERC20-compliant token with additional features such as burnable, pausable, and role-based access control, deployed on the Sepolia testnet. The backend provides API methods to interact with the smart contract, offering functionalities like retrieving token information, checking balances, and more.

### Contents

- **Smart Contracts**: Implementation of the NodeERC20 token, including features like minting, burning, pausing, and role-based access control.
- **Backend**: A Python FastAPI application that provides an API to interact with the NodeERC20 smart contract.
